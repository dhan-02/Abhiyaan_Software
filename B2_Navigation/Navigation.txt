An adaptive sensing strategy is more desirable than a pre-determined plan

Receive data from different types of sensors simultaneously
i.e visual,sounds,LIDARS,GPS,etc,,, so that when one fails others can be relied on...
More number of sensors can improve certainity

Developing better path planning algorithims which incorporate all the above sensory data

Something similar to a probabilistic model can be followed:
Calculate the probability of success for each possible action of navigation and 
Follow the one with the highest chance of success...

For the example of weather :

proofing such as water proofing to prevent reduction of quality of data(or damage on sensors)
Overcoming problems such as the robot behaving unexpectedly because it thinks rain is an obstacle..
