Why I want to work in the team:

I distinctly remember coming on a tour to IITM about two years ago and being astonished especially by the CFI...,
coming back home and searching about competition teams when Abhiyaan caught my eye...Autonomous vehicles have
always fascinated me and it has always been a dream to do something related to this. Infact this was one of the few things
that motivated me during my JEE days.... to come in and do these kind of things..I believe that the passion and fascination
that I have for this will help me put in a lot of effort to this and contribute..
